          Career Path Navigator was born from a simple observation: too many
          talented individuals struggle to navigate their career development due
          to information overload and lack of structured guidance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          Founded in 2023 by a team of educators, technologists, and career
          development experts, we set out to create a tool that combines the
          power of AI with human expertise to provide clear, actionable roadmaps
          for professional growth.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          Today, we're proud to help thousands of learners across the globe
          chart their path to success in fields ranging from software
